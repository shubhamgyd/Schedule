# Redundancy and types, in Image Compression

1. Redundancy is like `repeated information` in an image, wasting storage space.

2. There are three main types:
    * Spatial redundancy: Nearby pixels often have similar colors (e.g., smooth areas).

    * coding redundancy: Inefficient ways to represent data (e.g., long strings of the same value).

    * Psychovisual redundancy: Details invisible to the human eye (e.g., high-frequency color variations).   

3. Image compression algorithms exploit redundancy to represent the image with fewer bits.

4. Removing redundancy allows for smaller file sizes for transmission or storage.

5. The trade-off is between compression ratio and image quality (too much compression can introduce artifacts).
