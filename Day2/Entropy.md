# Entropy in image compression
1. Entropy in image compression refers to the `information content` or `randomness` of an image.

2. High entropy images have many details and complex features, needing more bits to store.
3. Low entropy images, like cartoons or flat backgrounds, have less information and can be compressed more efficiently.
4. Entropy helps determine the `theoretical limit` for how much an image can be compressed.
5. Image compression algorithms often use `entropy coding` to represent frequent data with fewer bits.
